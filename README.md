**Ignite Curiosity
**
 

Ignite Curiosity is our flagship intern program, designed to help students discover their career path and ignite their passion for technology. This program provides students with access to a variety of tools and resources, as well as the opportunity to connect with like-minded peers. The primary goal of Ignite Curiosity is to foster a learning environment where students can explore their interests and develop their skills in a supportive and collaborative setting. More information can be found at Ignitecuriosity.org.

 

**XpressLab
**
 

XpressLab is another one of our partner programs that introduces students to GitHub and Good First Issues (GFI). We encourage students to engage with GFIs from our partner organizations, providing them with the opportunity to make a real impact while learning. This hands-on approach not only enhances their technical skills but also gives them a sense of accomplishment and purpose. For more details, visit xpresslab.org.

 

**Developer Dojo
**
 

Developer Dojo is a comprehensive training area designed to equip students with the skills they need to build - be it software, business, or construction. In the realm of business, we teach Agile Lean, Toyota Production System, and Lean Six Sigma. For those interested in construction, we provide instruction in Building Information Modeling (BIM). In software development, we offer a course in ANDROID Ops, which includes automation, networking, design, research, optimization, implementation, and delivery. You can learn more at developerdojo.org.

 

In conclusion, these partner programs are a testament to RevelTek's commitment to fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation. We are confident that these programs will provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in the ever-evolving technology industry.
